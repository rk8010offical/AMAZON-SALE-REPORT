# Amazon Sales Report Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data and predicting future sales trends. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and statistical techniques, we gain insights into product revenue, sales distribution, and trends.

##  Dataset Information
The dataset contains key information about sales performance, including:
- **Product Name** – The name of the product sold.
- **Revenue** – Total earnings from product sales.
- **Sales** – Number of units sold.
- **Date/Time Data** – To analyze trends over time.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We perform various EDA techniques to extract insights:
- Identifying best-selling products and categories.
- Visualizing revenue and sales trends over time.
- Analyzing seasonality patterns and sales fluctuations.

## Future Sales Prediction
We use **statistical methods** to estimate future sales based on past trends, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

##  Installation & Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
Alternatively, open and run the **Jupyter Notebook** (`Amazon Sale report.ipynb`).
